Some useful tutorial This section serves at providing a start point for newbees. We need a fundamental understanding of some general concepts, an overview of the big picture, most frequently used tools, services, etc.
Linux basics One of the most comprehensive knowledge base about linux operating system and various of linux tools, softwares, services, I found so far, is the redhat documentation.</description></item><item><title>Recover Ubuntu from initramfs error caused by improper shutdown</title><link>/posts/recover_ubuntu_from_initramfs_error/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/recover_ubuntu_from_initramfs_error/</guid><description>Issue description Following a force shutdown of the server, the system failed to boot with following message:

Boot from a live CD/USB Could either burn a live iso to a USB stick or mount the ISO to the server (how to mount the ISO to a server via its BMC/IPMI tools, is out of the scope).</description></item><item><title>Route setting in Multihomed Server</title><link>/posts/dual_home_ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dual_home_ubuntu/</guid><description>The Issue For servers with multiples interfaces connecting to differenct networks, tend to have routing issues if multiple interfaces have default route settings. For example, I have a server with two NICs, one connect to external network in subnet 10.67.126.x/23, and the other connects to internal network in subnet 192.168.8.x/24. As the DHCP servers for the two subnets both provide default route, the routing table in my server will results in multiple default routes:</description></item><item><title>Deploy k8s Cluster Using kubespray</title><link>/posts/deploy_k8s_cluster_using_kubespray/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/deploy_k8s_cluster_using_kubespray/</guid><description>Introduction Nowadays, there&amp;rsquo;re couples of way to deploy a k8s cluster in various of form factors, from experimental cluster with a single node to production deployment with hundreds of servers.
This memo is a note for deploy a &amp;lsquo;product&amp;rsquo; k8s cluster using kubespray - limited by the resources for the experiment, no dedicated storage nodes provisioned, and the networking is not covered as well.
