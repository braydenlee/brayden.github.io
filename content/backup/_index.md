## Learn something new everyday

Apparently, it sounds cool to learn something new everyday, isn't it? Sometimes, yes. Most of the time, not exactly. You could be frustrated - if you learn from your own failures. Fortunately, you don't have to. It makes our lives much easier that learn from others' failures, experiences - so many blogs, webpages are there sharing the how-tos. And yes, that's the purpose of this site, to share my experiences, my failures, so you don't need to repeat the failure to learn.

## Share something now and then

Get things done is almost the first priority of our daily work. Spending efforts elsewhere appears not doing business. Wait, give it a second thought, how we resolve the problems efficiently? Who else provide the right help or support? And think about who else need your expertise to get their job done? Let's do the same thing to others as they are doing for us - share our experience, expertise in case it helps.

## Some useful tutorial

This section serves at providing a start point for newbees. We need a fundamental understanding of some general concepts, an overview of the big picture, most frequently used tools, services, etc.

### Linux basics

One of the most comprehensive knowledge base about linux operating system and various of linux tools, softwares, services, I found so far, is the redhat documentation. And it's free - no subscriptions required.  
[Product Documentation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 ](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8)  
Note that, it's worth a while to go over the document inventory for RHEL7, RHEL6 as well, as some of the documents could be only found in previous release.  
Besides, there're other distros with well orginised docs:  
- [openSUSE Documentation](https://doc.opensuse.org/)
- [Fedora User Documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/docs/)

### Virtualization, Containerization & cloud native

This subsection provides some references to the virtualization technologies (Mainly QEMU-kvm here), virtualization management (ovirt and RHV as known as RHEV previously), containers, and container management system (k8s).

- [QEMU Documentation](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/)  
A comprehensive document about all you need to know about QEMU
- [QEMU-KVM website](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page)
- [QEMU User Documentation](https://wiki.qemu.org/Category:User_documentation)
- [Libvirt Documentation](https://libvirt.org/docs.html)

- [Virt-manager website](https://virt-manager.org/)
Not well documented, while the tools are quite straightforward to use, and you could find quite a lot of blogs, howtos on the Internet, using the keywords - virt-manager, and its supporting tools, like virt-install, virt-clone, virt-viewer, etc.
- [Red Hat Virtualization](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.4)  
- [Open source virtualization](https://www.ovirt.org/documentation/)  
- [Openstack Documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/xena/?_ga=2.70887888.1343839674.1640432365-906552595.1638502134)
