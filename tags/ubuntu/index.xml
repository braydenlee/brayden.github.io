initramfs: waiting for /dev/mapper/ubuntu&amp;ndash;vg-ubuntu&amp;ndash;lv to appear &amp;hellip;
timeout waiting &amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip;
Then the init process crashed with kernel panic.
Solution As if it&amp;rsquo;s due to initramfs damage by the improper shutdown, so the solution is to re-generate the initramfs.
Boot from a live CD/USB Could either burn a live iso to a USB stick or mount the ISO to the server (how to mount the ISO to a server via its BMC/IPMI tools, is out of the scope).</description></item><item><title>Recover Ubuntu from initramfs error caused by improper shutdown</title><link>/posts/setting_up_nfs_server/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/setting_up_nfs_server/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Route setting in Multihomed Server</title><link>/posts/dual_home_ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/dual_home_ubuntu/</guid><description>The Issue For servers with multiples interfaces connecting to differenct networks, tend to have routing issues if multiple interfaces have default route settings. For example, I have a server with two NICs, one connect to external network in subnet 10.67.126.x/23, and the other connects to internal network in subnet 192.168.8.x/24. As the DHCP servers for the two subnets both provide default route, the routing table in my server will results in multiple default routes:</description></item></channel></rss>
